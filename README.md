# Angry Nerds - Web Interface

## Prerequisites

* Node JS V16.13.0+
* npm V8.1.0+
* vue js version 3
  
## NPM dependencies
* paper
* vue
* vue-router

## How to run ?

The first step is to open a terminal inside of the web interface directory and run the following command to install all the dependencies:
```
npm i
```
And to start the server, please run the following command:
```
npm run dev
```

The command will display two IPs to you, one local (that will only work on your computer), and a "Network" one, that will make the app visible to other devices on the network.
